			<p>Computers and video games have always been a part of Keith's life. Keith's interest in programming started in highschool when he took both Computer Engineering and Computer Sciences courses. Since then, he's taught himself different languages like Python and Javascript while learning Visual Basic and Assembly in highschool. After highschool, he continued to pursue the tech field by taking Conestoga College's Computer Programming/Analyst program. In 2020, he accumulated amazing grades for his first and second years in the program and was able to participate in the College's co-op program. He was then hired as a co-op student with Linamar Corp. doing Desktop Support Technician work for 8 months, then moved to 4 more months of Application Development with the same company. After completing his co-op year, he graduated college with an Ontario College Advanced Diploma with Distinction and an overall 3.7 GPA in 2022</p>
